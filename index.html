                <p>Hi! As you can tell by now my name is Michael LeGrange and I am excited to share a little about myself. I was born and raised in Baton Rouge. LA and lived there for about the first 21 years of my life. Growing up I loved sports but mostly played baseball. My love for baseball lead me to Nicholls State University where I played D1 baseball for the Colonels. After college I moved out west to Scottsdale Arizona. Out there I got into the tech world working for a digital agency, Yelp and a start up at the time knowm as Zenefits.</p>

        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-12">
                <p>I learned a ton and really enjoyed the tech space. I was in sales but secretly have always had a passion to be the guy creating the software and apps not just selling them. I met my future wife out there and we eventually moved to Chicago to be closer to her family. She is from Ohio and really... like really wanted to move back to the Midwest. I've now been in Chicago for over 3 years and getting used to it. The summers are great of course but I'm struggling with winter still. Last, I'm super pumped to finally be taking this long overdue step into development. Hope you like my sweet site!</p>
